# wm8731-another-hal

A thin HAL to control and configure the Cirrus Logic/Wolfson WM8731 audio
codec.

## Documentations

Unfortunatly, this chip is now end of life and datasheets are now unavailable
from Cirrus Logic Website. Fortunatly, I had a copy so I included them in the
project repository:

 * [WM8731_v4.9.pdf](WM8731_v4.9.pdf), main datasheet.
 * [WM8731_WAN0117.pdf](WM8731_WAN0117.pdf), supported sampling rates.

Documentation of this crate is available at https://docs.rs/wm8731-another-hal.
